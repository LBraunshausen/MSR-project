Decision trees (and thus random forests) are not of this kind. You will be taking different if/else branches in each tree. So this is not a good fit for GPUs. You will get horrible branch efficiency. Your performance will drop to less than 1/32 (i.e. 3%) of the theoretical capabilities of your hardware.From Wikipedia CUDA limitations:Same execution path = all 32 threads do the \"if true\" branch, or all 32 do the \"else\" branch.(There is a \"hack\" around this, but it is fairly expensive IMHO, and I don't think it will be fully competitive with approaches that are designed for GPUs e.g. via matrix multiplications right away. I'm too lazy to type it in - you'll find it in GPU literature for sure. It's fairly common to speed up single if operations. While this should be possible for multiple levels of if's, it will be much less effective because the cost is growing exponentially with the depth.

      "The idea I'm suggesting is originated in text-processing, NLP and information retrieval and very widely used in situations where you have sequences of characters/information like Genetic information. Because you have to preserve the sequence, we can use the concepts of n-grams. I'm using bi-grams in the following example, though you can generalize for higher order grams. N-grams help in preserving the sequential pattern in the data. Don't worry - we keep borrowing ideas from other fields of science - even edit distance and dynamic programming were not originally computer science concepts.There are many possible approaches to tackle this problem - each one unique, and there's no right one - atleast there's no sufficient research that proves which one is right. Here's my take on it. So the goal is to create a Bag-Of-Words like vector out of your data strings - and these vectors can be easily fed to any machine learning tool or library for clustering. A quick summary of steps:-Collect bigrams (and unigrams etc)Create a dictionary to get Bag Of Words (Code attached)Create functionality to get vector from a stringLet's get startedSo here These functions would convert the given string to a set of two characters (and single character if there's only one). You can modify them to capture 3-grams or even complete set of all possible uni-, bi- and tri-grams. Feel free to experiment.Now how to convert strings to vectors? We'll define a function that will convert string to vectors taking care of how many times a particular n-gram appears. This is called BAG OF WORDS. Here, these are BAGS OF SCREENS. Following two functions help you with that:Voila! We're done. Now feed your data vectors to any K-Means implementation of your choice. I used SKLearn. You should rather choose to read strings from a fileAnd then I finally see what my clusters look like using km.labels_ property of KMeans class.Here're your clusters. Look at the console (bottom) window - There are ten clusters.Now you can modify feature generation I wrote in the code and see how your modifications performs. Rather than just bigrams, extract all the possible unigrams, bigrams and trigrams and use them to create BOW. There will be significant difference. You can also use length of the string as a feature. You can also experiment with other algorithms including hierarchical clustering. Be sure to send me updated results after your modifications.Enjoy! \n",

Beacause empirical estimator of  is just , and as  is constant, then the weight becomes just , which is simple term frequency. So in this sense, scikit does what you need.Ok, so maybe you want to consider context? Then what kind of context? Do you want to analyze independently  and use it as a weighted sum for ? Then why not ? Why not  etc.? Why not to include some reweighting based on unigrams when bigrams are not available? The answer is quite simple, once you go into using language models as a weighting schemes, amount of possible introductions grows exponentialy, and there is no \"typical\" approach, which is worth implementing as a \"standard\" for a library which is not a NLP library.\n",

Depending on your programming language and code quality, it can also be much more due to memory management overhead. A typical Java implementation adds 8 bytes of overhead, and will round to 8 bytes size; so sparse vectors may easily use  bytes. then.If your sparsity is 1, this means a sparse representation needs 50% more memory. I guess the memory tradeoff in practise will be somewhere around 50% sparsity; and if your implementation isn't carefull optimized, maybe even 30% - so 1 out of 3 values should be a zero.Memory consumption is usually a key problem. The more memory you use, the more pagefaults and cache misses your CPU will have, which can have a big impact on performance (which is why e.g. BLAS perform large matrix multiplications in block sizes optimized for your CPU caches).3>Dense vector code (e.g. BLAS) is usually much better optimized than sparse operations. In particular, SIMD (single instruction, multiple data) CPU instructions usually only work with dense data.3>Many algorithms may need random access to vectors. If your data is represented as a  array, random access is . If your data is a sparse vector, random access usually is , i.e. you will have to scan the vector to check if there is a value present. It may thus be beneficial to transpose the matrix for some operations, and work with sparse columns instead of sparse rows.On the other hand, some algorithms may exactly benefit from this. But many implementations have such optimizations built in, and will take care of this automatically. Sometimes you also have different choices available. For example APRIORI works on rows, and thus will work well with row-sparse data. Eclat on the other hand is an algorithm to solve the same problem, but it first transforms all data into a row-sparse form, then even computes column differences to further optimize.3>Code to process sparse data usually is much more complex. In particular, it cannot make use of SSE and similar fast CPU instructions easily.

They cover how to prepare your data for you ML algorithms, refine it, fix it. Good data with good features dramatically increase the results.2) You don't need to use all of features from original data. Some of features of original dataset are meaningless and you don't need to use them. Try to run gradient boosting machine or random forest classifier from scikit-learn on your dataset to perform classification (or regression, if you do regression). These algorithms also evaluate importance of each feature of original dataset.

      "1) Random Forests Random forests is a idea of the general technique of random decision forests that are an ensemble learning technique for classification, regression and other tasks, that control by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random decision forests accurate for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set. The first algorithm for random decision forests was created by Tin Kam Ho using the random subspace method which, in Ho's formulation, is a way to implement the \"stochastic discrimination\" approach to classification proposed by Eugene Kleinberg. An extension of the algorithm was developed by Leo Breiman[5] and Adele Cutler,[2] and \"Random Forests\" is their trademark[3].The extension combines Breiman's \"bagging\" idea and random selection of features, introduced first by Ho and later independently by Amit and Geman[4] in order to construct a collection of decision trees with controlled variance. 2) Random Tree Random Tree is a supervised Classifier; it is an ensemble learning algorithm that generates lots of individual learners. It employs a bagging idea to construct a random set of data for constructing a decision tree. In standard tree every node is split using the best split among all variables. In a random forest, every node is split using the best among the subset of predicators randomly chosen at that node. Random trees have been introduced by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler.The algorithm can deal with both classification and regression problems. Random trees is a group (ensemble) of tree predictors that is called forest. The classification mechanisms as follows: the random trees classifier gets the input feature vector, classifies it with every tree in the forest, and outputs the class label that received the majority of “votes”. In case of a regression, the classifier reply is the average of the responses over all the trees in the forest. Random Trees are essentially the combination of two existing algorithms in Machine Learning: single model trees are merged with Random Forest ideas. Model trees are decision trees where every single leaf holds a linear model which is optimised for the local subspace explained by this leaf. Random Forests have shown to improve the performance of single decision trees considerably: tree diversity is created by two ways of randomization[4,6,11]. First the training data is sampled with replacement for each single tree like in Bagging. Secondly, when growing a tree, instead of always computing the best possible split for each node only a random subset of all attributes is considered at every node, and the best split for that subset is computed. Such trees have been for classification Random model trees for the first time combine model trees and random forests. Random trees uses this produce for split selection and thus induce reasonably balanced trees where one global setting for the ridge value works across all leaves, thus simplifying the optimization procedure.

      "I only have a basic knowledge of the type of classifiers and normalization techniques you're using, but the general rule, that I think applies to what you're doing as well, is to do the following.Your classifier is not a Random Forest Classifier. That is only one step of the pipeline that acts as your actual classifier. This pipeline / actual classifier is what you describe:Use a Random Forest Classifier on what you get from the first 2 steps.This pipeline, that encompasses 3 things, is what you're actually using as your classifier.Now, how does a classifier work?You build some state based on the training data.You use that state to make predictions on the test data.So:Your classifier normalizes the incoming features for the training data, so it will normalize those for unseen instances too. To do this, it must use the state it has built during training.For example, if you were doing min-max scaling on your features, your state would store a  and  for each feature . Then, during testing / prediction, you would do min-max scaling for each feature  using the stored  and  values.I'm not sure what you mean by \"normalize continuous numeric features\". Do you mean ? If you build some state for this discretization during training, then you need to find a way to factor that in.Don't you know how many values each category can have beforehand? Usually you do (since categoricals are things like nationality, continent etc. - things you know in advance). If you can get a value for a categorical feature that you haven't seen during training, it begs the question if you should even care about it. What good is a categorical value you've never trained on?Maybe add an \"unknown\" category. I think expanding for a single one should be fine, what good are more going to do if you've never trained on them?What kind of categoricals do you have?I could be wrong, but do you really need one-hot encoding?

Consider a case where we have 80% positives (label == 1) in the dataset, so theoretically we want to \"under-sample\" the positive class. The logistic loss objective function should treat the negative class (label == 0) with higher weight. Here is an example in Scala of generating this weight, we add a new column to the dataframe for each record in the dataset:  Then, we create a classier as follow:For more details, watch here: 2>A different issue you should check - whether your features have a \"predictive power\" for the label you're trying to predict. In a case where after under-sampling you still have low precision, maybe that has nothing to do with the fact that your dataset is imbalanced by nature.I would do a exploratory data analysis  - If the classifier doesn't do better than a random choice, there is a risk that there simply is no connection between features and class. Perform correlation analysis for every feature with the label.Generating class specific histograms for features (i.e. plotting    histograms of the data for each class, for a givenfeature on the    same axis) can also be a good way to show if afeature discriminates    well between the two classes.Overfitting - a low error on your training set and a high error on your test set might be an indication that you overfit using an overly flexible feature set.Bias variance - Check whether your classifier suffers from a high bias or high variance problem.Training error vs. validation error -  graph the validation error and training set error, as a function of training examples (do incremental learning) If the lines seem to converge to the same value and are close at the end, then your classifier has high bias. In such case, adding more data won't help. Change the classifier for a one that has higher variance, or simply lower the regularization parameter of your current one.If on the other hand the lines are quite far apart, and you have a low training set error but high validation error, then your classifier has too high variance. In this case getting more data is very likely to help. If after getting more data the variance will still be too high, you can increase the regularization parameter.\n",

Random Forest does not choose any parameters based on a validation set, so validation set is un-necessary.Also during the training of Random Forest, the data for training each individual tree is obtained by sampling by replacement from the training data, thus each training sample is not used for roughly 1/3 of the trees.

In particular, in your example above, the node  would have three children, corresponding to attribute values ,, and .It follows from the previous paragraph (and, in general, from the way the ID3 algorithm works) that any well-formed vector---of the form , where  is a value of -th attribute and  is the class value---should be classifiable by the decision tree that the algorithm learns on a given train set.Would you mind providing a link to the software you used to learn the \"incomplete\" trees?To answer your questions:Not that I know of. It doesn't make sense to learn such \"incomplete trees.\" If we knew that some attribute values will never occur then we would not include them in the specification (the file where you list attributes and their values) in the first place.With the ID3 algorithm, you can prove---as I sketched in the answer---that every tree returned by the algorithm will cover all possible combinations.You're using the wrong algorithm. Data has nothing to do with it.There is no such thing as an unclassifiable instance in decision-tree learning. One usually defines a decision-tree learning problem as follows. Given a train set  of examples  of the form  where  is the value of the -th attribute and  is the class value in example , learn a function (represented by a decision tree) , where  is the space of all possible well-formed vectors (i.e. all possible combinations of attribute values) and  is the space of all possible class values, which minimizes an error function (e.g. the number of misclassified examples).

As per ,Many common machine learning algorithms apply a function repeatedly to the same dataset to optimize a parameter (e.g., through gradient descent). While each iteration can be expressed as a MapReduce/Dryad job, each job must reload the data from disk, incurring a significant performance penaltySpark mllib's libraries remove this performance penalty by caching the data in memory during the first iteration. So subsequent iterations are extremely quick compared to the first iteration and hence, there is a significant reduction in model training time. I think, in your case, the executor memory might be insufficient to load a partition of data in memory. Hence contents would be spilled to disk and would need to be fetched from disk again in every iteration, thus killing any performance benefits of spark. To make sure, this is actually the case, you should try and look at the executor logs which would contain some lines like \"Unable to store rdd_x_y in memory\".If this is indeed the case, you'll need to adjust --num-executors, --executor-memory and numPartitions to see which values of these parameters are able to load the entire data into memory. You can try out with a small data set, single executor and a small value of executor memory on your local machine and analyze logs while incrementally increasing executor memory to see at which config the data is totally cached in memory. Once you have the configs for the small data set, you can do the Maths to figure out how many executors with how much memory are required and what should be the number of partitions for the required partition size.I had faced a similar problem and managed to bring down model training time from around 4 hours to 20 minutes by following the above steps.\n",

      "Some implementations of the SVM algorithm do provide probability estimates. However, the SVM does not inherently provide probability estimates. It is a function that is \"tacked on\" after the algorithm was created. These probability estimates are not \"trustworthy\", and if I remember correctly, the ability to compute probability estimates was removed from the Scikit-Learn library a few releases ago for this reason. Still, if you insist on using SVM, look at  from LibSVM. It is the library that OpenCV calls. You can skip the math to get to the tips. The outputs of LibSVM, and hence OpenCV's SVM, are explained in the document. Alternatively, you can choose to use LibSVM instead. This will allow you to get to the probability estimates without recompiling OpenCV (as suggested in your link), but the downside is you will have to pass your data to the appropriate form for LibSVM (i.e., OpenCV's Mat is unlikely to work directly with LibSVM).If you are using a Linear SVM, i.e., SVM with the linear kernel, then you can try replacing it with a Logistic Regression classifier as empirically they behave similarly (both are linear classifiers, just that one uses hinge loss and the other, logistic loss). The probability estimates from Logistic Regression would work.Alternatively, consider using a Random Forest (or its variant, Extremely Randomized Trees) classifier. They also provide probability estimates as the proportion of training samples in a given leaf node reached by your test sample. Having said that, these two classifiers are not based on principled mathematics (although researchers are working on figuring out how they work theoretically), although they have been known to work superbly in many real-world settings (Kinect pose estimation is an example).The thing is coming up with probability estimates is a very hard if your classifier is not designed to do that from the beginning, i.e., not one of those you find from a standard statistical machine learning textbook. It is like pulling numbers out of one's ass. Most algorithm that perform classification simply compute a \"score\" for each category/label for each test sample and go with the one with the \"best\" score. That is much easier to do. For the SVM, it tries to \"translate\" this score to a \"probability\", but it is not \"calibrated\", which effectively makes it useless.You can take a look at this paper:  for more details on how the probabilities are computed for some of these classifiers, and why they need to be calibrated.In general, I would advice taking probability estimates returned by classifier with a grain of salt. If you want them, go with a statistical classifier, e.g., Logistic Regression, not SVM.As for libraries, while OpenCV do provide some machine learning algorithms, they are very limited. Try a proper ML library.

If one is exactly duplicating the whole data set a number of times, then methods based on maximum likelihood (as with many models in common use) must find exactly the same result since the log likelihood function of the duplicated data is exactly a multiple of the unduplicated data's log likelihood, and therefore has the same maxima. (This argument doesn't apply to methods which aren't based on the likelihood function; I believe that CART and other tree models, and SVM's,  are such models. In that case you'll have to work out a different argument.)However, if by duplicating, one means duplicating the positive examples in a classification problem (which is common enough, since there are often many more negative examples than positive), then that does make a difference, since the likelihood function is modified.Also if one means bootstrapping, then that, too, makes a difference.PS.

In your example, this would beEach of those will be specialized in the following problems:Distinguishing between class 1 and class 2 (let's call it svma).Distinguishing between class 1 and class 3 (let's call it svmb)Distinguishing between class 2 and class 3 (let's call it svmc)Now, I see that actually you have asked multiple questions in your original post, so I will ask them separately. First I will clarify how the decision process works, and then tell how you could detect which features are the most important.Since you mentioned Accord.NET, there are two ways this framework might be computing the multi-class decision. The default one is to use a Decision Directed Acyclic Graph (DDAG), that is nothing more but the sequential elimination of classes. The other way is by solving all binary problems and taking the class that won most of the time. You can configure them at the moment you are classifying a new sample by setting the  of the .Since the winning-most-of-the-time version is straightforward to understand, I will explain a little more about the default approach, the DDAG.1>In this algorithm, we test each of the SVMs and eliminate the class that lost at each round. So for example, the algorithm starts with all possible classes:Now it asks svma to classify x, it decides for class 2. Therefore, class 1 lost and is not considered anymore in further tests:Now it asks svmb to classify x, it decides for class 2. Therefore, class 3 lost and is not considered anymore in further tests:The final answer is thus 2.1>Now, since the one-vs-one SVM is decomposed into (n(n-1)/2) binary problems, the most straightforward way to analyse which features are the most important is by considering each binary problem separately. Unfortunately it might be tricky to globally determine which are the most important for the entire problem, but it will be possible to detect which ones are the most important to discriminate between class 1 and 2, or class 1 and 3, or class 2 and 3.However, here I can offer a suggestion if your are using DDAGs. Using DDAGs, it is possible to . This means that is it possible to estimate how many times each of the binary machines was used when classifying your entire database. If you can estimate the importance of a feature for each of the binary machines, and estimate how many times a machine is used during the decision process in your database, perhaps you could take their weighted sum as an indicator of how useful a feature is in your decision process.By the way, you might also be interested in trying one of the Logistic Regression Support Vector Machines using L1-regularization with a high C to perform sparse feature selection:\n",

There are many aspects which alter this behavior, in particular features values scale, variance, generaly - features values distribution.In short. If your features are positive values, then sign of the feature shows towards which class thich feature is more correlated.

Svm task is to find the best margin-maximing hyperplane that best separates the data. We have soft margin representation of svm which is also known as primal form and its equivalent form is dual form of svm. Dual form of svm makes the use of kernel trick.kernel trick is partially replacing the feature engineering which is the most important step in machine learning when we have datasets that are not linear (eg. datasets in shape of concentric circles). Now you can transform this dataset from non-linear to linear by both FE and kernel trick. By FE you can square each of the features in this dataset and it will transform into linear dataset and then you can apply techniques like logisitic regression which work best for linear data.In kernel trick you can use the polynomial kernel whose general form is (a + x_i(transpose)x_j)^d where a and d are constants and d specifies the degree, suppose if the degree is 2 then we can say it is quadratic and likewise. now lets say we apply d =2 now our equation becomes (a + x_i(transpose)x_j)^2. lets the we 2 features in our original dataset (eg. for x_1 vector is [x_11,x__12] and x_2 the vector is [x_21,x_22]) now when we apply polynomial kernel on this we get we get 6-d vectors. Now we have transformed the features from 2-d to 6-d.Now you can see intuitively that higher your dimension of data better would svm work because it will eventually transform that features to a higher space. Infact the best case of svm is if you have high dimensionality, then go for svm.Now you can see both kernel trick and Feature Engineering solve and transforms the  dataset(concentric circle one)  but the difference is we are doing FE explicitly but kernel trick comes implicitly with svm. There is also a general purpose kernel know as Radial basis function kernel which can be used when you don't know the kernel in advance.RBF kernel has a parameter (sigma) if the value of sigma is set to 1, then you get a curve that looks like gaussian curve.You can consider kernel as a similarity metric only and can interpret if the distance between the points is less, higher will be the similarity. \n",

      "As in any other machine learning problem, if you do not have a quality criterion, you suck.When people say \"classification\", they have supervised learning in mind: there is some ground truth against which you can train and check your algorithms. If new classes can appear, this ground truth is ambiguous. Imagine one class is \"horse\", and you see many horses: black horses, brown horses, even white ones. And suddenly you see a zebra. Whoa! Is it a new class or just an unusual horse? The answer will depend on how you are going to use your class labels. The SVM itself cannot decide, because SVM does not use these labels, it only produces them. The decision is up to a human (or to some decision-making algorithm which knows what is \"good\" and \"bad\", that is, has its own \"loss function\" or \"utility function\").So you need a supervisor. But how can you assist this supervisor? Two options come to mind: Anomaly detection. This can help you with early occurences of new classes. After the very first zebra your algorithm sees it can raise an alarm: \"There is something unusual!\". For example,  various algorithms from random forest to one-class SVM can be used to detect unusial observations. Then your supervisor can look at them and decide whether they deserve to form an entirely new class.Clustering. It can help you to make decision about splitting your classes. For example, after the first zebra, you decided it is not worth making a new class. But over time, your algorithm has accumulated dozens of their images. So if you run a clustering algorithm on all the observations labeled as \"horses\", you might end up with two well-separated clusters. And it will be again up to the supervisor to decide, whether the striped horses should be detached from the plain ones into a new class. If you want this decision to be purely authomatic, you can split classes if the ratio of within-cluster mean distance to between-cluster distance is low enough. But it will work well only if you have a good distance metric in the first place. And what is \"good\" is again defined by how you use your algorithms and what your ultimate goal is.\n",

It's mainly due to the fact that the features have more meaningful information compared to the pixel values. (They can describe edges,shapes, texture, etc.) However, the algorithms like deep learning will extract the useful features as a part of learning procedure.2 - How much positives and negatives per coin should be given?You need to answer this question depending on the variation in the classes you want to recognize and the learning algorithm you use. For SVM , if you use HOG features and want to recognize specific numbers on coins you won't need much. 3- Would i have to learn also on rotated coins or would this rotation be handled \"automagically\" by the SVM? So would the SVM recognize rotated coins, even if i only trained it on non-rotated coins?Again it depends on your final decision about the features(not SVM which is the learning algorithm) you're going to choose.

      "Faster is a bit of a weird question, in part because it is hard to compare apples to apples on this, and it depends on context. LR and SVM are very similar in the linear case. The TLDR for the linear case is that Logistic Regression and SVMs are both very fast and the speed difference shouldn't normally be too large, and both could be faster/slower in certain cases. From a mathematical perspective, Logistic regression is strictly convex [its loss is also smoother] where SVMs are only convex, so that helps LR be \"faster\" from an optimization perspective, but that doesn't always translate to faster in terms of how long you wait.Part of this is because, computationally, SVMs are simpler. Logistic Regression requires computing the  function, which is a good bit more expensive than just the  function used in SVMs, but computing these doesn't make the majority of the work in most cases. SVMs also have hard zeros in the dual space, so a common optimization is to perform \"shrinkage\", where you assume (often correctly) that a data point's contribution to the solution won't change in the near future and stop visiting it / checking its optimality. The hard zero of the SVM loss and the  regularization term in the soft margin form allow for this, where LR has no hard zeros to exploit like that.  However, when you want something to be fast, you usually don't use an exact solver. In this case, the issues above mostly disappear, and both tend to learn just as quick as the other in this scenario. In my own experience, I've found Dual Coordinate Descent based solvers to be the fastest for getting exact solutions to both, with Logistic Regression usually being faster in wall clock time than SVMs, but not always (and never by more than a 2x factor). However, if you try and compare different solver methods for LRs and SVMs you may get very different numbers on which is \"faster\", and those comparisons won't necessarily be fair. For example, the SMO solver for SVMs can be used in the linear case, but will be orders of magnitude slower because it is not exploiting the fact that you only care are Linear solutions. \n",

Indeed the SVM model will be trained thanks to the training set and the training labels and once the training phase has finished you can use another set (called Validation Set or Test Set), which is structured in the same way as the training set, to test the accuracy of your SVMs.In other words the SVM workflow should be structured as follows:train the SVM using the training set and the training labelspredict the labels for the validation set using the model trained in the previous stepif you know what the actual validation labels are, you can match the predicted labels with the actual labels and check how many labels have been correctly predicted. The ratio between the number of correctly predicted labels and the total number of labels in the validation set returns a scalar between [0;1] and it's called the accuracy of your SVM model.if you're interested in the ROI, you might want to check the trained SVM parameters (mainly the weights and bias) to reconstruct the separation hyperplaneIt is also important to know that the training set records should be correctly, a priori labelled: if the training labels are not correct, the SVM will never be able to correctly predict the output for previously unseen patterns.

My goal is to extract the corresponding chain of decisions for some particular samples. I think your problem is a subset of mine, since you just need to record the last step in the decision chain.Up to now, it seems the only viable solution is to write a custom  method in Python to keep track of the decisions along the way. The reason is that the  method provided by scikit-learn cannot do this out-of-box (as far as I know). And to make it worse, it is a wrapper for C implementation which is pretty hard to customize.Customization is fine for my problem, since I'm dealing with a unbalanced dataset, and the samples I care about (positive ones) are rare. So I can filter them out first using sklearn  and then get the decision chain using my customization.However, this may not work for you if you have a large dataset.

I can look into why this is not there by default... Importing existing Python script modulesA common use-case for many data scientists is to incorporate existing Python scripts into Azure Machine Learning experiments. Instead of concatenating and pasting all the code into a single script box, the Execute Python Script module accepts a third input port to which a zip file that contains the Python modules can be connected. The file is then unzipped by the execution framework at runtime and the contents are added to the library path of the Python interpreter. The azureml_main entry point function can then import these modules directly.As an example, consider the file Hello.py containing a simple “Hello, World” function. Figure 4. User-defined function.Next, we can create a file Hello.zip containing Hello.py: Figure 5. Zip file containing user-defined Python code.Then, upload this as a dataset into Azure Machine Learning Studio. If we then create and run a simple experiment a uses the module:  Figure 6.

In the general case, the model is described by its support vectors and their weights, so its size depends on the number of SVs that were found, and may be quite large.Some software libraries, like libsvm, do not have specialized code to deal with linear SVM classification, so the model representation and classification function are inefficient in terms of memory and running time.

Otherwise no ML algorithm will be able to help you, without the description of what exactly you want to achieveQ: Is there any idea or application in Machine Learning which tries to improve the quality of collected data?A: I don't think so just because the question itself is too open-ended.

They cover how to prepare your data for you ML algorithms, refine it, fix it. Good data with good features dramatically increase the results.2) You don't need to use all of features from original data.

Try to run gradient boosting machine or random forest classifier from scikit-learn on your dataset to perform classification (or regression, if you do regression).

You may want to do some processing of the text and create more useful features (perhaps detecting the presence of zip codes, positions of numbers, etc...)Edit: Using the raw text column as one feature will not get you anywhere. You don’t want your model to learn the addresses the way they are written. Instead, you need to learn patterns in the text that provide evidence for address vs. non-address instances.When you use feature hashing, the text column will be transformed to multiple word (or n-gram) columns, where the values represent counts of those words in each text input. The problem here is overfitting. For example, these two addresses have no words in common:“100 broadway st, GA” and “200 main rd, NY” but it’s clear they have similar structure. One way to create ‘useful features’ is to replace the words with tags: “#NUM #TXT, #STATE” and use feature hashing (bi-grams) to create features such as “#NUM #TXT” and “, #STATE”. As you can see, these bi-grams count as evidence in both addresses and suggest some kind of similarity between them (compared to other non-address instances). Of course this is an oversimplification of the problem but I hope you see why you can’t use the raw text or plain feature hashing.You can still use the Azure ML modules for feature hashing, training, and scoring in addition to an ‘Execute R’ module to do the text processing before training.Edit: Example of feature hashing usage:  \n",

      "Both methods work with a population that is improved over many generations. The key difference is how the population is represented.Genetic Algorithms (GAs) work on individuals of the population, e.g. through mutation. You can enumerate the ancestors of each individual.The Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) represents the population as a probability distribution. Individuals are drawn from this distribution. The distribution parameters are re-estimated from the best e.g. 2% and the other 98% are discarded.Technically, &quot;the best 2%&quot; is also a probability distribution. You could draw a very large sample from it, but it's expensive. So you try to approximate &quot;the 2% distribution&quot; with your simple distribution. The  measures the difference between two distributions, which you want to minimize. Often this is simpler than it sounds: if your distribution is a Gaussian you can just estimate a new mean and (co-)variance from the best 2%.Practical considereations:The CEM requires you to come up with a probability distribution over individuals. Most GAs also require such a distribution only to generate the initial population, in addition to parameters like mutation strength.The CEM is simple to implement and has few parameters. It is a great baseline algorithm, and occasionally it beats methods that are much more sophisticated. However CMA-ES is a better baseline for continuous problems with just a few hundred parameters, because of its strong track record.Estimating parameters from just 2% of the population requires a very large population size. Throwing away 98% of the information is wasteful. On the other hand, it prevents the CEM from stepping &quot;sideways&quot; and getting distracted by sub-optimal solutions.GAs can be much more fancy and exist in many problem-specific variations. The CEM can be adapted to a problem by choosing a clever distribution. This works great for some discrete problems. Generally I'd say using a GA is one step up from the CEM, both in complexity (harder to get it working right) and in terms of potential performance (more opportunities to adapt its operators to the problem).References: (Mannor et al, 2003)(Szita and Lörincz, 2006) (Botev et al., 2013)\n",

      "The number of filters is the number of neurons, since each neuron performs a different convolution on the input to the layer (more precisely, the neurons' input weights form convolution kernels).A feature map is the result of applying a filter (thus, you have as many feature maps as filters), and its size is a result of window/kernel size of your filter and stride.The following image was the best I could find to explain the concept at high level:Note that 2 different convolutional filters are applied to the input image, resulting in 2 different feature maps (the output of the filters). Each pixel of each feature map is an output of the convolutional layer.For instance, if you have 28x28 input images and a convolutional layer with 20 7x7 filters and stride 1, you will get 20 22x22 feature maps at the output of this layer. Note that this is presented to the next layer as a volume with width = height = 22 and depth = num_channels = 20. You could use the same representation to train your CNN on RGB images such as the ones from the CIFAR10 dataset, which would be 32x32x3 volumes (convolution is applied only to the 2 spatial dimensions).EDIT: There seems to be some confusion going on in the comments that I'd like to clarify. First, there are no neurons. Neurons are just a metaphor in neural networks. That said, \"how many neurons are there in a convolutional layer\" cannot be answered objectively, but relative to your view of the computations performed by the layer. In my view, a filter is a single neuron that sweeps through the image, providing different activations for each position. An entire feature map is produced by a single neuron/filter at multiple positions in my view. The commentors seem to have another view that is as valid as mine. They see each filter as a set of weights for a convolution operation, and one neuron for each attended position in the image, all sharing the same set of weights defined by the filter. Note that both views are functionally (and even fundamentally) the same, as they use the same parameters, computations, and produce the same results. Therefore, this is a non-issue.\n",

Here's a quick overview though- A neural network works by having some kind of features and putting them through a layer of \"all or nothing activations\". These activations have weights and this is what the NN is attempting to \"learn\". NNs kind of died in the 80-90's because the systems couldn't find these weights properly. This was until the awesome  - who thoughy to pretrain the network with a restricted boltzman machine to get the weights in the right ball park.It depends on your goal, but if your goal is to learn how they work, I would start with Hinton's original paper and rewrite it to have functions instead of the static 3 layer network thats in the paper. This will give you a good intuition of whats going on in terms of the weights being learned and the activations. Now to answer your second question- there's a bit of debate- but in my experience the most key factor is coming up with the architecture of the system these variables are as follows: number of layers number of visible nodes  number of hidden nodes per layerOther variables you can control are what I would classify as optimization variables.

      "You've chosen a slightly confusing example for a couple of reasons. First, when you say , you aren't adding a new training point, you're just doing a new prediction, so that doesn't require any changes at all. Second, KNN algorithms aren't really \"trained\" -- KNN is an  algorithm, which means that \"training\" amounts to storing the training data in a suitable structure. As a result, this question has two different answers. I'll try to answer the KNN question first.K Nearest NeighborsFor KNN, adding new training data amounts to appending new data points to the structure. However, it appears that  doesn't provide any such functionality. (That's reasonable enough -- since KNN explicitly stores every training point, you can't just keep giving it new training points indefinitely.) If you aren't using many training points, a simple list might be good enough for your needs! In that case, you could skip  altogether, and just append new data points to your list. To make a prediction, do a linear search, saving the  nearest neighbors, and then make a prediction based on a simple \"majority vote\" -- if out of five neighbors, three or more are red, then return red, and so on. But keep in mind that every training point you add will slow the algorithm.If you need to use many training points, you'll want to use a more efficient structure for nearest neighbor search, like a . There's a  K-D Tree implementation that ought to work. The  method allows you to find the  nearest neighbors. It will be more efficient than a list, but it will still get slower as you add more training data.Online LearningA more general answer to your question is that you are (unbeknownst to yourself) trying to do something called . Online learning algorithms allow you to use individual training points as they arrive, and discard them once they've been used. For this to make sense, you need to be storing not the training points themselves (as in KNN) but a set of parameters, which you optimize.This means that some algorithms are better suited to this than others.  provides just a few algorithms . These all have a  method that will allow you to pass training data in batches. The  with  or  loss is probably a good starting point. \n",

After that, the feature vector will look like (-0.4,-0.8). The number should be between -1 and 0 if the suggested formula in part 4.1 is used. Then use the normalized feature to calculate the distances (Euclidean in the handout) between every training data point and your interested company ( normalized as well).  This is required in 4.2.

      "This is my first answer at SO, so here it goes..Your understanding in both parts seem to be correct, according to this paper :The paper explains word2vec in detail and at the same time, keeps it very simple - it's worth a read for a thorough understanding of the neural net architecture used in word2vec.The structure of Skip Gram does use a single neural net, with input as one-hot encoded target-word and expected-output as one-hot encoded context words. After the neural-net is trained on the text-corpus, the input weight matrix W   is used as the input-vector representations of words in the corpus and the output weight matrix W' which is shared across all the C outputs (output-vectors in the terminology of the question, but avoiding that to prevent confusion with output-vector representations used next..), becomes the output-vector representations of words. Usually the output-vector representations are ignored, and the input-vector representations, W are used as the word embeddings. To get into the dimensionality of the matrices, if we assume a vocabulary size of V, size of hidden layer as N, we will have W as (V,N) matrix, with each row representing the input vector of the indexed word in the vocabulary. W' will be a (N,V) matrix, with each column representing the output vector of the indexed word. In this way we get N-dimensional vectors for words.As you mentioned, each of the outputs(avoiding using the term output vector) is of size V and are the result of a softmax function, with each node in the output giving the probability of the word occurring as a context word for the given target word, resulting in the outputs not being one-hot encoded.But the expected outputs are indeed one-hot encoded, i.e in training phase, the error is computed by subtracting the one-hot encoded vector of the actual word occurring at that context position, from the neural-net output and then the weights are updated using gradient descent.Referring to the example you mentioned, with C=1 and with a vocabulary of  ['quick', 'fox', 'jumped', 'lazy', 'dog'] If the output from the skip-gram is [0.2 0.6 0.01 0.1 0.09], where the correct target word is 'fox' then error is calculated as -[0 1 0 0 0] - [0.2 0.6 0.01 0.1 0.09] = [-0.2 0.4 -0.01 -0.1 -0.09]and the weight matrices are updated to minimize this error.Hope this helps !\n",

      "Clustering is one of the biggest areas of machine learning (proportionally you could compare it to, say, \"integration\" in mathematics, or \"sorting\" in programming), and there are literally hundreds of different algorithms, focused on different problem settings and requirements. Some of them require to specify the number of clusters, some don't. Some can work with just the pairwise similarity, some require some explicit representation of the items being clustered, etc.I suggest you to start with two of the classical clustering algorithms: - here, you specify the number of clusters (\"k\") in advance, however the objects being clustered have to be points in a vector space (there are ways to reduce the problem of document clustering to a vector space problem - search for \"term vector representation\"). Since you're dealing with cosine similarity, looks like you already have a vector space, so you can use K-means. (in particular, \"single-linkage agglomerative clustering\" ) - here, you only need the pairwise similarities: you build a tree by repeatedly finding the two most similar documents and joining them into the same cluster, until you have the desired number of clusters.\n",

      "K-Means clustering is an iterative algorithm that makes multiple passes over the data. In each pass, points are assigned to cluster centroids and then after all points have been assigned, the cluster centroids are recomputed to be the mean of the assigned points. You can't \"stream\" data to the algorithm in the traditional sense as you'll need to come back to it during the subsequent iterations.Regarding the OpenIMAJ  implementation: yes this can handle \"big data\" in the sense that it doesn't mind where it gets the data from - the  instance that it takes as input can read data from disk if necessary. The only requirement is that you can hold all the centroids in memory during the runtime of the algorithm. The implementation is multi-threaded, so all cpu cores can be used during computation. There is example code here: .The OpenIMAJ  methods can be used to save the resultant cluster centroids in the  object.One of the biggest costs in K-Means is the computation of distances between each data point and each cluster centroid in order to find the closest. The cost of this is related to the dimensionality of the data and the number of centroids. If you've got a large number of centroids and high dimensional data, then using an approximate K-Means implementation can have big speed benefits at the cost of a slight loss in accuracy (see  for example -- this uses an ensemble of KD-Trees to speed neighbour computations). Regarding integration with Hadoop, it is possible to implement K-Means as a series of Map-Reduce tasks (each pair corresponds to an iteration of the algorithm). See this paper for a discussion:  . If you want to go down this route, OpenIMAJ has a very rough implementation here, which you could build off: . As mentioned in the linked paper, Apache Mahout also contains an implementation: . One problem with both of these implementations is that they required quite a lot of data to be transferred between the mappers and reducer (each mapper emits the current data point and its assigned cluster id). The extent of this could mean that it could be faster to use a non-Hadoop implementation of the algorithm, but this would depend on what processing resources you have available and the nature of the dataset. The problem of data-transfer between the map and reduce could probably also be reduced with a clever Hadoop  and computes weighted centroids from subsets of the data and then passes these to the (modified) reducer to compute the actual centroids.\n",

      "I think there's some confusion here about the space in which you're doing your K-means clustering. In the code snippet that you included in your question, you're training up a  model using the vectorized face images as data points. K-means clusters live in the same space as the data you give it, so (as you noticed) your cluster centroids will also be vectorized face images. Importantly, these face images have dimension 9216, not dimension 2 (i.e., x-y coordinates)!To get 2-dimensional (x, y) coordinates as your K-means centroids, you need to run the algorithm using 2-dimensional input data. Just off the top of my head, it seems like you could apply a darkness threshold to your face images and assemble a clustering dataset of only the dark pixel locations. Then after you run K-means on this dataset, the centroids will hopefully be close to the pixel locations in your face images where there are the most dark pixels. These locations (assuming the face images in your training data were already somewhat registered) should be somewhat close to the eyes and mouth corners that you're hoping for.This can be really confusing so I'll try to add an example. Let's say just for an example you have \"face images\" that are 3 pixels wide by 4 pixels tall. After thresholding the pixels in one of your images it might look like:If you use this \"image\" directly in K-means, you're really running your K-means algorithm in a 12-dimensional space, and the image above would be vectorized as:Then your K-means cluster centroids will also live in this same 12-dimensional space.What I'm trying to suggest is that you could extract the (x, y) coordinates of the 1s in each image, and use those as the data for your K-means algorithm. So for the example image above, you'd get the following data points:In this example, we've extracted 3 2-dimensional points from this one \"image\"; with more images you'd get more 2-dimensional points. After you run K-means with these 2-dimensional data points, you'll get cluster centroids that can also be interpreted as pixel locations in the original images. You could plot those centroid locations on top of your images and see where they correspond in the images.\n",

      "The most direct way to handle data of that form while still using k-means it to use a kernelized version of k-means. 2 implemtations of it exist in the JSAT library (see here )As Nicholas said, another option is to create a new feature space on which you run k-means. However this takes some prior knowledge of what kind of data you will be clustering. After that, you really just need to move to a different algorithm. k-means is a simple algorithm that makes simple assumptions about the world, and when those assumptions are too strongly violated (non linearly separable clusters being one of those assumptions) then you just have to accept that and pick a more appropriate algorithm. \n",

If you only want the strength of an edge in such an image, you don't need the direction of the edge. You don't need the image either. The strength of the edge is just the difference of two intensities which is nice because you can use k-means if your distance metric is transitive.If you have the rgb colors, just convert them to grayscale and group them up with k-means.Another thing is, if you use canny from a library it may be applying some smoothing before calculating the strengths which may not be desired for you.\n",

      "As it was already noted, the answer heavily depends on an algorithm being used.If you're using distance-based algorithms with (usually default) Euclidean distance (for example, k-Means or k-NN), it'll rely more on features with bigger range just because a \"typical difference\" of values of that feature is bigger.Non-distance based models can be affected, too. Though one might think that linear models do not get into this category since scaling (and translating, if needed) is a linear transformation, so if it makes results better, then the model should learn it, right? Turns out, the answer is no. The reason is that no one uses vanilla linear models, they're always used with with some sort of a regularization which penalizes too big weights. This can prevent your linear model from learning scaling from data.There are models that are independent of the feature scale. For example, tree-based algorithms (decision trees and random forests) are not affected. A node of a tree partitions your data into 2 sets by comparing a feature (which splits dataset best) to a threshold value. There's no regularization for the threshold (because one should keep height of the tree small), so it's not affected by different scales.That being said, it's usually advised to standardize (subtract mean and divide by standard deviation) your data.\n",

A good starting point is the  (80-20). Sometimes using a simple split isn't an option as you might simply have too much data - in that case you might need to sample your data or use smaller testing sets if your algorithm is computationally complex. An important part is to randomly choose your data. The trade-off is pretty simple: less testing data = the performance of your algorithm will have bigger variance. Less training data = parameter estimates will have bigger variance.For me personally more important than the size of the split is that you obviously shouldn't always perform your tests only once on the same test split as it might be biased (you might be lucky or unlucky with your split). That's why you should do tests for several configurations (for instance you run your tests X times each time choosing a different 20% for testing). Here you can have problems with the so called model variance - different splits will result in different values. That's why you should run tests several times and average out the results.With the above method you might find it troublesome to test all the possible splits.

      "OK, before we actually get into the details, let's give a brief overview on what K-means clustering is first.   works such that for some data that you have, you want to group them into k groups.  You initially choose k random points in your data, and these will have labels from .  These are what we call the centroids. Then, you determine how close the rest of the data are to each of these points.  You then group those points so that whichever points are closest to any of these k points, you assign those points to belong to that particular group ().  After, for all of the points for each group, you update the centroids, which actually is defined as the representative point for each group.  For each group, you compute the average of all of the points in each of the k groups.  These become the new centroids for the next iteration.  In the next iteration,  you determine how close each point in your data is to each of the centroids.  You keep iterating and repeating this behaviour until the centroids don't move anymore, or they move very little.How you use the  function in MATLAB is that assuming you have a data matrix ( in your case), it is arranged such that each row is a sample and each column is a feature / dimension of a sample.  For example, we could have  or  arrays of Cartesian coordinates, either in 2D or 3D.  In colour images, we could have  arrays where each column is a colour component in an image - red, green or blue.How you invoke  in MATLAB is the following way: is the data matrix we talked about,  is the total number of clusters / groups you would like to see and the outputs  and  are respectively an index and centroid matrix.   is a  array where  is the total number of samples that you have put into the function.  Each value in  tells you which centroid the sample / row in  best matched with a particular centroid.  You can also override the distance measure used to measure the distance between points. By default, this is the Euclidean distance, but you used the cosine distance in your invocation. has  rows where each row is a centroid.  Therefore, for the case of Cartesian coordinates, this would be a  or  array.  Therefore, you would interpret  as telling which group / centroid that the point is closest to when computing k-means.  As such, if we got a value of  for a point, this means that the point best matched with the first centroid, which is the first row of .  Similarly,  if we got a value of  for a point, this means that the point best matched with the third centroid, which is the third row of . Now to answer your questions:We just talked about  and  so this should be clear.The final centres are stored in .  Each row gives you a centroid / centre that is representative of a group.It sounds like you want to find the closest point to each cluster in the data, besides the actual centroid itself.  That's easy to do if you use  which performs K-Nearest Neighbour search by giving a set of points and it outputs the  closest points within your data that are close to a query point.  As such, you supply the clusters as the input and your data as the output, then use  and skip the first point.  The first point will have a distance of 0 as this will be equal to the centroid itself and the second point will give you the closest point that is closest to the cluster.You can do that by the following, assuming you already ran :You run , then toss out the closest point as it would essentially have a distance of 0.  The second column is what you're after, which gives you the closest point to the cluster excluding the actual centroid.   will give you which points in your data matrix  that was closest to each centroid.

So if tuning the parameters doesn't help reduce overfitting then you may want to try a similar parameter tuning strategy for a simpler hypothesis such as a linear SVM or another classifier you think may be appropriate for your domain.Regularization as you mentioned is definitely a good idea if its available.The prediction of the same label makes me think that label imbalance may be an issue and for this case you could use different class weights. So in the case of an SVM each class gets its own C penalty weight. Some estimators in sklearn accept fit params that allow you to set a sample weights to set the amount of penalty for individual training samples.Now if you think the features may be an issue I would use feature selection by looking at F-values provided by f_classif and could be use with something like SelectKBest.

If your data were evenly balanced across classes like , randomly sampling with (or without replacement) will give you approximately eqal sample sizes of  and . However, if your data is more like where one class over represents the data, k-fold cv without weighted sampling would give you erroneous results.If you use ordinary k-fold CV without adjusting sampling weights from uniform sampling, then you'd obtain something likewhere there are clearly splits without useful representation of both classes.The point of k-fold CV is to train/test a model across all subsets of data, while at each trial leaving out 1 subset and training on k-1 subsets.In this scenario, you'd want to use split by strata. In the above data set, there are 27  and 5 . If you'd like to compute k=5 CV, it wouldn't be reasonable to split the strata of  into 5 subsets. A better solution is to split it into k &lt; 5 subsets, such as 2. The strata of  can remain with k=5 splits since it's much larger. Then while training, you'd have a simple product of  from the data set. Here is some code to illustrateThis method can accomplish splitting the data into partitions where all partitions are eventually left out for testing. It should be noted that not all statistical learning methods allow for weighting, so adjusting methods like CV is essential to account for sampling proportions.Reference: James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., &amp; Tibshirani, R.

You'd have to use both  and  as input samples into your neural network and the output will have to be a two neuron output where  as the output would denote that the circles class is what the classification should be and  is what the crosses classification would be. In addition, each column is an input sample while each row is a feature.  Therefore, you have to transpose both of these and make a larger input matrix.  You'll also need to make your output labels in accordance with what we just talked about:Now train your network:Now, if you want to figure out which class each point belongs to, you simply take the largest neuron output and whichever one gave you the largest, that's the class it belongs to.Now, to answer your actual question, there's no direct way to show the \"lines\" of separation with Neural Networks if you use the MATLAB toolbox.  However, you can show regions of separation and maybe throw in some transparency so that you can overlay this on top of the figure.To do this, define a 2D grid of coordinates that span your two classes but with a finer grain... say... 0.01.  Run this through the neural network, see what the maximum output neuron is, then mark this accordingly on your figure.Something like this comes to mind:The first two lines of code generate a bunch of test  points and ensures that they're in a 2 row input matrix as that is what the network inputs require.  I use  for generating these points.  Next, we use  to simulate or put in inputs into the neural network.  Once we do this, we will have two output neuron neural network responses per input point where we take a look at which output neuron gave us the largest response.  If the first output gave us the largest response, we consider the input as belonging to the first class.  If not, then it's the second class.  This is facilitated by using  and looking at each column independently - one column per input sample and seeing which location gave us the maximum.Once we do this, we create a new figure and plot the points that belonged to class 1, which is the circles, in yellow and the second class, which is the crosses, in green.  I throw in some transparency to make sure we can see the regions with the points.   After, I plot the points as normal using your code.With the above code, I get this figure:As you can see, your model has some classification inaccuracies.  Specifically, there are three crosses that would be misclassified as circles.

Therefore,  one hidden layer is sufficient for the large majority of problems.There are some empirically-derived rules-of-thumb, of these, the most commonly relied on is 'the optimal size of the hidden layer is usually between the size of the input and size of the output layers'.

You mentioned that you have category name, but basing on google graphics it seems that it may not be obvious whether Shirt or TShirt has long or short sleevs.My solution is quite simple:Find face on imageUse grabcut algorithm to extract face mask from imageMask face (so after this step only face is left - everythin else is black). Note that this step is not necessary - i've mentioned it only, because it's shown on final image.Convert image to HSV color spaceUsing face mask calculate histogram for H and S color channels of FACE ONLY (without rest of the image)Calculate back projection of hsv image using histogram from previous step. Thanks for that you will get only regions which color (in HSV) is similar to color of face - so you will get only regions which contains skin.  Threshold the result (there is always some noise :) )The final result of this algorithm is black and white image which shows skin regions. Using this image you can calculate number of pixels with skin and check whether skin is only on face or maybe somewhere else. You can try to find contours as well - generally both solututions will give chance to check if hands  are visible. Yes - shirt has short sleevs, no - long sleevs.  Here are the results (from top-left corner - original image, face mask (result of grabcut algorithm), masked face, hsv image, result of calculating back projection, result of using threshold on previous one):As you can see, unfortunetely it fails for image 3, because face is in very similar color to shirt pattern (and generally face color is quite close to white - something is wrong with this guy, he should spend more time outside ;) ).  Source is quite simple, but if you don't understand something feel free to ask:Checking pattern (stipped, plain, something else?) and determining color of shirtHere i would try to extract (mask) the shirt from the image and than operate only on it. To achieve it i would try to use similar approach as in previous part - grabcut algorithm. Initializing it might be harder this time. Quite easy (but probably not perfect) solution which comes to my mind is:set rect around almost whole area (leave just few pixels on each side)initialize mask to  value in the middle of the image - just draw some circle in the middle using  \"color\"set mask to  in the corners of the image set mask to  in face rectangle (the one founded using Haar cascade in step \"Checking whether image shows shirt with long or short sleevs\")Alternatively you can initialize whole mask as  or  and use watershed algorithm to find the big white area (which is backgrund). Once you have this area - use it as background.Most likely using those 2 solutions together will give you the best results.  You can try much easier solution as well. It looks like all images has got SHIRT not background, skin or anything else sligtly over the center of it. Just like here:so you can just analyze only this part of shirt. You can try to localize this sure shirt part of image using Haar cascade as well - just find face and than move the founded rectangle down. Once you have masked shirt you can calculate its parameters. 2 things which i would try are:convert it to HSV color space and calculate histograms (2 separates - not one as we did in previous step) for Hue and for Saturations channels. Comparing those histograms for 2 shirts should give you chance to find shirt with similar colors. For comparing histogram i would use some (normalized) correlation coefficients.use Fourier transform to see what frequencies are the most common in this shirt. For plain shirts it should be much smaller frequencies than for stripped.  I know that those solutons aren't perfect, but hope it helps.

Results are... not very good, not very bad - better than nothing, but definitely not perfect ;) I would say it's good point to start.Package with code and images (yours + some from google) is . Code:Some lines are commented - you can try to use them, maybe you will achieve better results.Basic algorithm is quite simple - for each image:cut shirt sample from image (just move down rectangle with face by 2* it height)convert this rect to gray colorspace and resize to (256, 256)calculate fft of this samplecalculate magnite spectrum of fft transformnormalize it (from 0 to 255)threshold it (clear all values &lt;200) - this will remove noise etc.Now we can calculate normalized cross corelation of this image between all shirt samples. High result -> similar samples. Final results:Image with all the shirt samples, magnitude spectrums (before and after threshold) is here:  The images names are (in the same order as samples on this big image): As you can see, thresholded images are quite similar for samples with same pattern. I think that this solution could work better if you just find a better way to compare those images (thresholded magnitude spectrums).edit2:Just a simple idea - after you crop shirt samples from lot of shirts, you can try to train some classifier and than recognize patterns them using this classifier. Look for tutorials about training Haar or LBP(local binary pattern) cascades. \n",

As such, they make it possible to compute the semantic similarity between two words, for example as a cosine between their individual vectors. You can download these embeddings directly from the word2vec site, or from related project sites such as . In order to model similarity between paragraphs, one simple solution is to compute paragraph embeddings by taking a weighted sum of the embeddings of all the words in that paragraph.

      "There's no straightforward way to merge the end-results of separate training sessions.Even for the exact same data, slight randomization from initial seeding or thread scheduling jitter will result in diverse end states, making vectors only fully comparable within the same session.This is because every session finds a useful configuration of vectors... but there are many equally useful configurations, rather than a single best. For example, whatever final state you reach has many rotations/reflections that can be exactly as good on the training prediction task, or perform exactly as well on some other task (like analogies-solving). But most of these possible alternatives will not have coordinates that can be mixed-and-matched for useful comparisons against each other. Preloading your model with data from prior training runs might improve the results after more training with new data, but I'm not aware of any rigorous testing of this possibility. The effect likely depends on your specific goals, your parameter choices, and how much the new and old data are similar, or representative of the eventual data against which the vectors will be used. For example, if the Google News corpus is unlike your own training data, or the text you'll be using the word-vectors to understand, using it as a starting point might just slow or bias your training. On the other hand, if you train on your new data long enough, eventually any influence of the preloaded values could be diluted to nothingness. (If you really wanted a 'blended' result, you might have to simultaneously train on the new data with an interleaved goal for nudging the vectors back towards the prior-dataset values.)Ways to combine the results from independent sessions might make a good research project. Maybe the method used in the word2vec language-translation projects – learning a projection between vocabulary spaces – could also 'translate' between the different coordinates of different runs. Maybe locking some vectors in place, or training on the dual goals of 'predict the new text' and 'stay close to the old vectors' would give meaningfully improved combined results. \n",

      "Neural networks learn by gradient descent an error function in the weight space which is parametrized by the training examples. This means the variables are the weights of the neural network. The function is \"generic\" and becomes specific when you use training examples. The \"correct\" way would be to use all training examples to make the specific function. This is called \"batch gradient descent\" and is usually not done for two reasons:It might not fit in your RAM (usually GPU, as for neural networks you get a huge boost when you use the GPU).It is actually not necessary to use all examples.In machine learning problems, you usually have several thousands of training examples. But the error surface might look similar when you only look at a few (e.g. 64, 128 or 256) examples.Think of it as a photo: To get an idea of what the photo is about, you usually don't need a 2500x1800px resolution. A 256x256px image will give you a good idea what the photo is about. However, you miss details.So imagine gradient descent to be a walk on the error surface: You start on one point and you want to find the lowest point. To do so, you walk down. Then you check your height again, check in which direction it goes down and make a \"step\" (of which the size is determined by the learning rate and a couple of other factors) in that direction. When you have mini-batch training instead of batch-training, you walk down on a different error surface. In the low-resolution error surface. It might actually go up in the \"real\" error surface. But overall, you will go in the right direction. And you can make single steps much faster!Now, what happens when you make the resolution lower (the batch size smaller)?Right, your image of what the error surface looks like gets less accurate. How much this affects you depends on factors like:Your hardware/implementationDataset: How complex is the error surface and how good it is approximated by only a small portion?Learning: How exactly are you learning (momentum? newbob? rprop?)\n",

This suggests that your classification algorithms need tuning, or that the data themselves are not as amenable to classification as you would like.You might also check that you've cleaned that data appropriately; a few errors can seriously move the class boundaries.What I suspect is happening is a small-boundary effect: each class, when compared against the combination of the other four, \"pulls in\" its boundaries, leaving unclaimed territory between the final sets.Do you have a way to check the classification parameters after training?  If so, can you visualize the five boundaries selected?  If you do find pathological gaps, are there training parameters you can tune, such as giving a larger epsilon to the training groups?I hope this helps.\n",

      "The standard backpropagation algorithm (gradient descent) gets serious issues when the number of layers becomes large. The probability of local minima in the error function increases with every layer. Not only local minima in a mathematical sense cause problems, sometimes there are just flat regions in the error function (modifying one or more weights does not significantly change the error) where gradient descent does not work.On the other hand, networks with many layers can solve more difficult problems, as every layer of cells can also provide a layer of abstraction.Deep Learning addresses exactly this problem. The basic idea is to perform an unsupervised learning procedure on every single layer in addition to using gradient descent for the network as a whole. The goal of the unsupervised learning is to make each single layer extract characteristic features out of its input that can be used by subsequent layers.Although the term \"Deep Learning\" is currently being used much too widely, it is more than just a marketing hype.Edit: A few years ago, many people, including myself, believed that unsupervised pre-training was the main enabler of deep learning.

This assures that each update in the weights is done in the \"right\" direction (Fig. ): the one that minimizes the cost function.With the growth of datasets size, and complexier computations in each step, Stochastic Gradient Descent came to be preferred in these cases. Here, updates to the weights are done as each sample is processed and, as such, subsequent calculations already use \"improved\" weights. Nonetheless, this very reason leads to it incurring in some misdirection in minimizing the error function (Fig. ).As such, in many situations it is preferred to use Mini-batch Gradient Descent, combining the best of both worlds: each update to the weights is done using a small batch of the data. This way, the direction of the updates is somewhat rectified in comparison with the stochastic updates, but is updated much more regularly than in the case of the (original) Gradient Descent.[UPDATE] As requested, I present below the pseudocode for batch gradient descent in binary classification:(In the case of multi-class labeling, error represents an array of the error for each label.)This code is run for a given number of iterations, or while the error is above a threshold.

      " is excellent, but I thought I'd add a bit of intuition as to why random forest fails in this case.You have to keep in mind that Machine Learning isn't some magic way to impart intelligence to computers; it's simply a way of fitting a particular model to your data and using that model to make generalizations. As the old adage goes, \"all models are wrong, but some are useful\". You've hit on a case where the model is wrong as usual, but also happens to be useless!The output space: Random forests at their core are basically a clever and generalizable way of mapping inputs to outputs. Your output space has  possible unique outputs, and only  of these are valid (i.e. outputs with one of each number). The only way for a random forest to know whether an output is valid is if it has seen it: so in order to work correctly, your training set will have to include examples with all of those 120 outputs.The input space: when a random forest encounters an input it has seen before, it will map that directly to an output that it has seen before. But what if it encounters an input it has not seen? For example, what if you ask for the answer to  and this is not in the training set? In terms of Euclidean distance (a useful way to think about how things are grouped) the closest result will probably be something like , which might map to , which is wrong. Thus we see that in order for random forests to work correctly, your training set will have to have all possible inputs. Some quick combinatorics show that your training set will have to be of size at least , with no duplicates.The forest itself: even if you have a complete input space, the random forest does not consist of a simple dictionary mapping of inputs to outputs. Depending on the parameters of the model, the mapping is typically from groups of nearby results to a single answer, so that, for example,  will all map to . This sort of generalization is useful in most cases, but is not useful for your particular problem. The only way for the random forest to work in your case would be to push the  and  parameters to their extreme values, so that the forest is essentially a one-to-one mapping of inputs to their correct outputs: in other words your classifier would be just an extremely complicated way of building a dictionary.To summarize: Machine Learning is just a model applied to data, which is useful in certain cases. In your case, the model is not all that useful: in order for Random Forests to work on your problem, you'd need to over-fit a comprehensive set of inputs and outputs. At that point, you might as well just construct a dictionary and call it a day.\n",

The output classes are:You need to try several classification algorithms to see which one works better. For evaluation you can use cross-validation or you can put away say 728 or the samples and evaluate on that.For classification models you iterate over 10 different classification models available in Machine Learning libraries and check which one is better. I suggest using scikit-learn for simplicity.You can find a simple iterator over several classifiers in .Remember that you need to tune some parameters for each model and you shouldn't tune them on the test set. So it is better to divide your samples into 1000 (training set), 350 (development set), 378 (test set). Use the development set to tune your parameters and to choose the best performing model and then use the test set to evaluate that model over unseen data.\n",

      "From my understanding of Machine Learning theory, Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM) and K-Means differ in the fundamental setting that K-Means is a Hard Clustering Algorithm, while GMM is a Soft Clustering Algorithm. K-Means will assign every point to a cluster whereas GMM will give you a probability distribution as to what is the probability of the point to belong in each of the 5 clusters. Furthermore, this also depends on the kind of parameters are you using for GMM. It could be possible for GMM to produce clusters somewhat similar to K-Means if you use a constant variance.Now, I am not sure about this because you need to provide more information on how you are picking Hard Clusters from GMM and how are you calculating the cluster centers. If you are just making a hard assignment from GMM based on the cluster which has the maximum probability, then it could be possible that they get assigned to the same clusters. In my opinion this will be possible only if the data points are easily separable and your GMM is assuming constant variance. As far as the cluster centers go, it depends on the way you are calculating them. If you are using the mean vectors obtained from GMM, then it is very very unlikely that K-Means and GMM will give you same cluster centers. On the other hand if you are first generating Hard clusters like mentioned above and then calculating the centers yourself, then it could be possible that they have the same centers when the hard clustering for all your points is the same in both K-Means and GMM.I think you should provide more information about the way you are doing this, so that the community members can better help you. Also you should also identify your use case well and decide whether you need Hard or Soft Clustering. Choose GMM only if you desire soft clustering and/or you have a prior belief that your data points have been generated from Gaussian Distributions for each cluster.\n",

      "The short answer is yes, kind of. Read on.Definition of Machine LearningTo understand what Machine Learning is let's first define the term . The often quoted definition by Tom M. Mitchell (1) is as follows:Meaning?This sounds quite formal, however it just says computers learn from experience that they are presented with in terms of data. The data to enable learning exists relative to a specific task and consists of several parameters:T, a task to accomplish, e.g. predict housing price predictionsE, some value of experience, e.g. prices observedP, some value of performance, e.g. how many prices are predicted Example: Housing pricesOnce a program has learnt from these inputs, it can take a new, previously unseen experience and from that predict, in our example, the specific housing price. The housing price might be strongly correlated to say location, age and size of house or apartment, and the luxury of its interiors. What is the result of a learning algorithm?In its simplest form then a machine learning algorithm for housing prices might implement a  analysis. It takes as input a body of data that relates real, observed prices to the four features location, age, size, luxury. The process of learning produces a regression model that in essence assigns a weight to each feature, of the formThat is, the weights  are learned from the input data,  is the predicted price. The learning is considered successful once the formula is able to successfully predict housing prices based on a list of features alone. Usually a prediction is considered successful if it falls within a certain bound (%-range) of the real price. Note that the definition of successful very much depends on the kind of task that the program must learn, however the result needs to be substantially better than a pure random guess (that is, the ratio of correct results needs to be statistically significant).Is there more to it?Yes, a lot. Some pointers can be found in this . If you are keen to get into the subject, professor  is quite famous, although there are many more courses if you look for it.

      "For statistical machine learning lejlot has given a very good answer. However, decision tree learning are a bit different. It uses a greedy search towards a good structure which might result in weird outcomes here. Historically this is because they come from a time when Machine Learning was more of an art (or engineering, but that sounds less sexy)..Before continuing we need two ensure two properties (the first has already been explained by lejlot)This duplications are not due to an error in the data collection processYour data is still i.i.d. in case you want to do LOO or CV, train, test, validation split. This one looks extremely important to me. If seen many example where this spoiled all properties of the statistical evaluation. Especially, train/test splits might be applied for pruning etc. If so and your examples are not independent you need to make sure that they end up in the same fold For numerical data I would immediately become very suspicious that either of these is violated. Given these assumption -- and in addition that you use C4.5 -- we can analyse the impact on the learned model. If we assume, that your classes are separable by a decision tree and you do not put up any constrains it doesn't make any difference. In this case you can actually safely remove them, however, keeping them doesn't make a big difference either on the classifications. However, the structure of the tree can be largely influenced by these added examples. Without calculating the actual values for / index I assume that the first split will be on . And this is the most important result of these extra example: the greediness of C4.5 will drive the structure towards something which captures these examples very well. You could call that structure overfitting for a certain class.  This can be a problem if this difference is rather marginal compared to other features. SVMs would react here much nicer (not a surprise: statistical ML).In total I would actually keep them and remove them. During inducing the structure of the tree i would ignore them and only calculate the structure on the remaining examples. However, for calculating the classifications in the leaves and for pruning I would use them. The previous paragraph contains the most important recommendation: I would apply pruning on the tree in such a domain. \n",

      "Both methods work with a population that is improved over many generations. The key difference is how the population is represented.Genetic Algorithms (GAs) work on individuals of the population, e.g. through mutation. You can enumerate the ancestors of each individual.The Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) represents the population as a probability distribution. Individuals are drawn from this distribution. The distribution parameters are re-estimated from the best e.g. 2% and the other 98% are discarded.Technically, &quot;the best 2%&quot; is also a probability distribution. You could draw a very large sample from it, but it's expensive. So you try to approximate &quot;the 2% distribution&quot; with your simple distribution. The  measures the difference between two distributions, which you want to minimize. Often this is simpler than it sounds: if your distribution is a Gaussian you can just estimate a new mean and (co-)variance from the best 2%.Practical considereations:The CEM requires you to come up with a probability distribution over individuals. Most GAs also require such a distribution only to generate the initial population, in addition to parameters like mutation strength.The CEM is simple to implement and has few parameters. It is a great baseline algorithm, and occasionally it beats methods that are much more sophisticated. However CMA-ES is a better baseline for continuous problems with just a few hundred parameters, because of its strong track record.Estimating parameters from just 2% of the population requires a very large population size. Throwing away 98% of the information is wasteful. On the other hand, it prevents the CEM from stepping &quot;sideways&quot; and getting distracted by sub-optimal solutions.GAs can be much more fancy and exist in many problem-specific variations. The CEM can be adapted to a problem by choosing a clever distribution. This works great for some discrete problems. Generally I'd say using a GA is one step up from the CEM, both in complexity (harder to get it working right) and in terms of potential performance (more opportunities to adapt its operators to the problem).References: (Mannor et al, 2003)(Szita and Lörincz, 2006) (Botev et al., 2013)\n",

This is being added to the Universal Recommender.\"People who liked this also liked these\": these are items similar to one being viewed, for example, and are the same for all users.

This assures that each update in the weights is done in the \"right\" direction (Fig. ): the one that minimizes the cost function.With the growth of datasets size, and complexier computations in each step, Stochastic Gradient Descent came to be preferred in these cases. Here, updates to the weights are done as each sample is processed and, as such, subsequent calculations already use \"improved\" weights. Nonetheless, this very reason leads to it incurring in some misdirection in minimizing the error function (Fig. ).As such, in many situations it is preferred to use Mini-batch Gradient Descent, combining the best of both worlds: each update to the weights is done using a small batch of the data. This way, the direction of the updates is somewhat rectified in comparison with the stochastic updates, but is updated much more regularly than in the case of the (original) Gradient Descent.[UPDATE] As requested, I present below the pseudocode for batch gradient descent in binary classification:(In the case of multi-class labeling, error represents an array of the error for each label.)This code is run for a given number of iterations, or while the error is above a threshold.

There are  rows (in this case, 2000), which represent the number of observations/data points that you have. There are also  columns (in this case, 1000), which represent the number of \"features\" that each data points has. For example, if your data consisted of 2D points, then  would equal 2. is the number of clusters that you want to group the data into. Based on the dimensions of  that you gave,  must be 8.Now I will answer the three parts:The  matrix has dimensions . Each row represents a centroid. Centroid locations DO NOT have to be (x, y) at all. The dimensions of the centroid locations are equal to . In other words, if you have 2D points, you could graph the centroids as (x, y). If you have 3D points, you could graph the centroids as (x, y, z). Since each data point in  has 1000 features, your centroids therefore have 1000 dimensions.This is sort of difficult to explain without knowing what your data is exactly. Centroids are certainly not just values, and they may not necessarily be locations. If your data  were coordinate points, you could certainly represent the centroids as locations. However, we can view it more generally. If you had a cluster centroid  and the data points  that are grouped with that centroid, the centroid would represent the data point that is most similar to those in its cluster. Hopefully, that makes sense, and I can give a clearer explanation if necessary.The k-means method actually gives us a good way to accomplish this.

      "Linear SVM is a special case of general soft margin kernel SVM in which the model can be expressed as a single weight vector w and a bias b, so that classification is done by y = w'*x+b (this is the decision value; you can threshold it with zero, as you did, or choose another value to tradeoff precision/recall). In the general case, the model is described by its support vectors and their weights, so its size depends on the number of SVs that were found, and may be quite large.Some software libraries, like libsvm, do not have specialized code to deal with linear SVM classification, so the model representation and classification function are inefficient in terms of memory and running time. You can, however, easily convert the model representation to the above linear classifier, by calculated the weighted sum of all the SVs, using the stored SV weight. You can then write your own linear classification function, using whatever means you want to make it run fast (e.g. vectorized code)\n",

      "Supervised learning is when you have labeled training data. In other words, you have a well-defined target to optimize your method for.Typical (supervised) learning tasks are classification and regression: learning to predict categorial (classification), numerical (regression) values or ranks (learning to rank).Unsupservised learning is an odd term. Because most of the time, the methods aren't \"learning\" anything. Because what would they learn from? You don't have training data?There are plenty of unsupervised methods that don't fit the \"learning\" paradigm well. This includes dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA (which by far predates any \"machine learning\" - PCA was proposed in 1901, long before the computer!). Many of these are just data-driven statistics (as opposed to parameterized statistics). This includes most cluster analysis methods, outlier detection, ... for understanding these, it's better to step out of the \"learning\" mindset. Many people have trouble understanding these approaches, because they always think in the \"minimize objective function f\" mindset common in learning.Consider for example DBSCAN. One of the most popular clustering algorithms. It does not fit the learning paradigm well. It can nicely be interpreted as a graph-theoretic construct: (density-) connected components. But it doesn't optimize any objective function. It computes the transitive closure of a relation; but there is no function maximized or minimized.Similarly APRIORI finds frequent itemsets; combinations of items that occur more than minsupp times, where minsupp is a user parameter. It's an extremely simple definition; but the search space can be painfully large when you have large data. The brute-force approach just doesn't finish in acceptable time. So APRIORI uses a clever search strategy to avoid unnecessary hard disk accesses, computations, and memory. But there is no \"worse\" or \"better\" result as in learning. Either the result is correct (complete) or not - nothing to optimize on the result (only on the algorithm runtime).Calling these methods \"unsupervised learning\" is squeezing them into a mindset that they don't belong into. They are not \"learning\" anything. Neither optimizes a function, or uses labels, or uses any kind of feedback. They just SELECT a certain set of objects from the database: APRIORI selects columns that frequently have a 1 at the same time; DBSCAN select connected components in a density graph. Either the result is correct, or not.Some (but by far not all) unsupervised methods can be formalized as an optimization problem. At which point they become similar to popular supervised learning approaches. For example k-means is a minimization problem. PCA is a minimization problem, too - closely related to linear regression, actually. But it is the other way around. Many machine learning tasks are transformed into an optimization problem; and can be solved with general purpose statistical tools, which just happen to be highly popular in machine learning (e.g. linear programming). All the \"learning\" part is then wrapped into the way the data is transformed prior to feeding it into the optimizer. And in some cases, like for PCA, a non-iterative way to compute the optimum solution was found (in 1901). So in these cases, you don't need the usual optimization hammer at all.\n",

      "PCA extracts the most important information from the data set and compresses the size of the data set by keeping only the important information - principal components. The first principal component is constructed in such a way that it has the largest possible variance. The second component is computed under the constraint of being orthogonal to the first component and to have the largest possible variance.In your case the data is a set of images. Let's say you have 1000 images and you compute the first five principal components (5 images, constructed by the PCA algorithm). You may represent any image as 900 data points (30x30 pixels) or by the combination of 5 images with the corresponding miltiplication coefficients. The goal of the PCA algorithm is to construct these 5 images (principal componenets) in such a way that images in your data set are represented most accurately with the combination of the given number of principal components.UPDATE:Consider the image below (from the amazing book by ). The image shows how points in 2 dimensions (red dots) are represented in 1 dimension (green crosses) by projecting them to the vector (purple line). The vector is the first principal component. The purpose of PCA is to build these vectors to minimize the reconstruction error. In your case these vectors can be represented as images.You may refer to  article for more details on using PCA for handwritten digit recognition.\n",

      "First a bit of nomenclature: PCA finds the eigenvectors of the data covariance matrix, and then transforms the data into the basis of eigenvectors. The result of this operation has two parts: The transformed data, and the eigenvectors used for transformation. Usually it is the first that is called principal components (PCs). There is no established name for the second, but I like the term principal modes (PMs). Your question is about the interpretation of the PMs.The interpretation of PMs is generally hard, if not impossible. Of course they have a simple technical interpretation, PCA looks for directions in the data space along which a maximum amount of variation occurs, and the PMs are those directions. For the first component this maximization is free, and captures the main direction along which variation occurs. Later components are constrained to be orthogonal to the ones before, which often leads to more and more complex, high-frequency patterns which are harder and harder to interpret.In the case of your data set, the situation may be different, because it probably has some kind of cluster structure in a very high-dimensional space, where the clusters correspond to the digits 0–9. It has  that in such a case there is a weak correspondence between PCA and k-means clustering, such that the first PMs tend to recover the space spanned by the cluster centroids. In this case the first PMs will be mixtures of cluster centroid patterns, possibly even approximately coinciding with these patterns. I think this is what explains your observation.More information in response to the OP's comments:The Wikipedia snippet cited above refers to Ding and He (2004), K-means Clustering via Principal Component Analysis . They write in the abstract: \"Here we prove that principal components are the continuous solutions to the discrete cluster membership indicators for K-means clustering.\" To my understanding this means that the \"component load\", the value of the principal component for a given data point is or at least is related to an indicator of whether that data point belongs to a cluster. They continue, \"Equivalently, we show that the subspace spanned by the cluster centroids are given by spectral expansion of the data covariance matrix truncated at K − 1 terms.\" This means that the subspace of the data space (in your case 900-dimensional) that is spanned by the first K – 1 principal modes (eigenvectors) is or is close to the space spanned by the (differences between) the cluster centroids (the mean image for each digit). If this is the case, most of the between-cluster variance is captured by those first principal components.Think of it this way: The PCA allows to reduce the 900 dimensions of the data to about 10 dimensions, by reconstructing all 30x30 images from a set of 10 \"typical\" 30x30 images. That means, each image can be approximately encoded by 10 numbers instead of 900 numbers. In order for this to be possible, the \"typical\" images have to be similar to how a \"0\", a \"1\", etc. looks like on average. In the simplest case, the 10 images could just be the average \"0\", average \"1\" etc. itself. That is not normally the case, but it can be approximately the case. Does this help? That \"0\" corresponds to the strongest PC is just coincidence I think.\n",

A feature reduction usually is done via a principal component analysis (PCA) which involves a singular value decomposition. It finds the directions with highest variance -- that is, those direction in which \"something is going on\".In your case, a PCA might find the black line as one of the two principal components:The projection of your data onto this one-dimensional subspace than yields the reduced form of your data.Already with the eye one can see that on this line the three feature sets can be separated -- I coloured the three ranges accordingly. For your example, it is even possible to completely separate the data sets. A new data point then would be classified according to the range in which its projection onto the black line lies (or, more generally, the projection onto the principal component subspace) lies.Formally, one could obtain a division with further methods that use the PCA-reduced data as input, such as for example clustering methods or a K-nearest neighbour model.So, yes, in case of your example it could  be possible to make such a strong reduction from 2D to 1D, and, at the same time, even obtain a reasonable model.\n",

Even if each feature in your final feature matrix represents a different time, most classifiers cannot learn about the fact that feature 2 follows feature 1 etc. So you lose the natural temporal ordering by doing this.If you care about the the temporal relationship between these features you may want to take a look at recurrent neural networks, which allow you feed information from t-1 into a node, at the same time as feeding in your current t features. So in a sense they learn about the relationship between t-1 and t features which will help you preserve temporal ordering.

All of this is done in order to reduce the dimensions of the feature space, i.e. transform the large feature space to one that is more manageable but still retains most if not all of the information. Now for your problem, you are trying to explain the variance across your 400 observations using 153600 features, however, we don't need that much information 399 PC's will explain 100% of the variance across your sample (I will be very surprised if that is not the case). The reason for that is basicly overfitting, your algorithm finds noise that explain every observation in your sample. So what the rayryeng was telling you is correct, if you want to reduce your feature space to 10,000 PC's you will need 100,000 observations for the PC's to mean anything (that is a rule of thumb but a rather stable one).And the reason that matlab was giving you 399 PC's because it was able to correctly extract 399 linear combinations that explained some #% of the variance across your sample. If on the other hand what you are after are the most relevant features than you are not looking for dimensional reduction flows, but rather feature elimination processes. These will keep only the most relevant feature while nulling the irrelevant ones.  So just to make clear, if your feature space is rubbish and there isn't any information there just noise, the variance explained will be irrelevant and will indeed be less than 100% for example see the following   Again if you want to reduce your feature space there are ways to that even with a small m, but PCA is not one of them.

From Wikipedia :Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of original variables. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components.\n",

      "Say you have a column vector V containing ONE flattened spectrogram. PCA will find a matrix M whose columns are orthogonal vectors (think of them as being at right angles to every other column in M).Multiplying M and T will give you a vector of \"scores\", which can be used to determine how much variance each column of M captures from the original data and each column of M captures progressively less variance in the data.Multiplying matrix M' (the first 2 columns of M) by V will produce a 2x1 vector T' representing the \"dimension-reduced spectrogram\". You could reconstruct an approximation of V by multiplying T' by the inverse of M'.  This would work if you had a matrix of spectrograms, too. Keeping only two principal components would produce an extremely lossy compression of your data.But what if you want to add a new song to your dataset? Unless it is very much like the original song (meaning it introduces little variance to the original data set), there's no reason to think that the vectors of M will describe the new song well. For that matter, even multiplying all the elements of V by a constant would render M useless. PCA is quite data specific. Which is why it's not used in image/audio compression. The good news? You can use a Discrete Cosine transform to compress your training data. Instead of lines, it finds cosines that form a descriptive basis, and doesn't suffer from the data specific limitation. DCT is used in jpeg, mp3 and other compression schemes.\n",

The crucial difference is that feature reduction (PCA) maps your data to lower dimensional through some projection of all original dimensions, for example PCA uses linear combination of each.

For example, if you're clustering images, the resulting centers can be viewed as images to get insight into the clustering. Alternatively, you can do a nearest-neighbor search on these results to recover the original data point that most closely approximates the center.Keep in mind, though, that PCA is lossy and KMeans is fast, and so it's probably going to be more useful to run KMeans on the full, unprojected data:In this simple case, all three methods produce very similar results.\n",

The neural network should be able to learn based on this parameters as depth translates to the different channels of the training images.UPDATE:In  each layer of your CNN it learns regularities about training images.  In the very first layers, the regularities are curves and edges, then when you go deeper along the layers you start learning higher levels of regularities such as colors, shapes, objects etc. This is the basic idea, but there lots of technical details. Before going any further give this a shot : UPDATE 2:Have a look at the first figure in the link you provided. It says 'In this example, the red input layer holds the image, so its width and height would be the dimensions of the image, and the depth would be 3 (Red, Green, Blue channels).' It means that a ConvNet neuron transforms the input image by arranging its neurons in three dimeonsion. As an answer to your question, depth corresponds to the different color channels of an image.Moreover, about the filter depth. The tutorial states this.Every filter is small spatially (along width and height), but extends through the full depth of the input volume.Which basically means that a filter is a smaller part of an image that moves around the depth of the image in order to learn the regularities in the image.UPDATE 3:For the real world example I just browsed the original paper and it says this : The first convolutional layer filters the 224×224×3 input image with 96 kernels of size 11×11×3 with a stride of 4 pixels.In the tutorial it refers the depth as the channel, but in real world you can design whatever dimension you like.

So subsequent iterations are extremely quick compared to the first iteration and hence, there is a significant reduction in model training time. I think, in your case, the executor memory might be insufficient to load a partition of data in memory. Hence contents would be spilled to disk and would need to be fetched from disk again in every iteration, thus killing any performance benefits of spark. To make sure, this is actually the case, you should try and look at the executor logs which would contain some lines like \"Unable to store rdd_x_y in memory\".If this is indeed the case, you'll need to adjust --num-executors, --executor-memory and numPartitions to see which values of these parameters are able to load the entire data into memory. You can try out with a small data set, single executor and a small value of executor memory on your local machine and analyze logs while incrementally increasing executor memory to see at which config the data is totally cached in memory. Once you have the configs for the small data set, you can do the Maths to figure out how many executors with how much memory are required and what should be the number of partitions for the required partition size.I had faced a similar problem and managed to bring down model training time from around 4 hours to 20 minutes by following the above steps.\n",

To me, it looks like your problem is overdetermined, which makes it much easier. You can imagine it as a system of equations, say you have 4 observations Y1,Y2,Y3 and Y4 (which are the 4 rows of data you are talking about, and ofc you need all 4 rows). And say you have 4 independent source in your mixture. You can represent this as:and Y3 and Y4 should follow suit. To separate, you have several methods from PCA, ICA, to model based approach such as GMM/HMM/FHMM and Neural Network based methods ANN/DNN etc. The specific method you choose is somewhat dependent on how mixed your signals are, in other words, how sparse is your signal. For example, if your signals are completely frequency independent, then a simple filter would suffice. You choose ICA which returns 4 rows representing the 4 components of your mixture (assuming that you used ICA correctly). You need to provide your ICA result for us to help you further. \n",

      "Usually, n-grams more than 1 is better as it carries more information about the context in general. However, sometimes unigrams are also calculated besides bigram and trigrams and used as fallback for them. This is usefull also, if you want high recall than precision to search unigrams, for instance, you are searching for all possible uses of verb \"make\". Lets use Statistical Machine Translation as an Example:Intuitively, the best scenario is that your model has seen the full sentence (lets say 6-grams) before and knows its translation as a whole. If this is not the case you try to divide it to smaller n-grams, keeping into consideration that the more information you know about the word surroundings, the better the translation. For example, if you want to translate \"Tom Green\" to German, if you have seen the bi-gram you will know it is a person name and should remain as it is but if your model never saw it, you would fall back to unigrams and translate \"Tom\" and \"Green\" separately. Thus \"Green\" will be translated as a color to \"Grün\" and so on. Also, in search knowing more about the surrounding context makes the results more accurate.\n",

The type of layer imposes further relational inductive biases:More generally, non-relational inductive biases used in deep learning include:activation non-linearities,weight decay,dropout,batch and layer normalization,data augmentation,training curricula,optimization algorithms,anything that imposes constraints on the learning trajectory.2>In a Bayesian model, inductive biases are typically expressed through the choice and parameterization of the prior distribution. Adding a Tikhonov regularization penalty to your loss function implies assuming that simpler hypotheses are more likely.1>The stronger the inductive bias, the better the sample efficiency--this can be understood in terms of the bias-variance tradeoff. Many modern deep learning methods follow an “end-to-end” design philosophy which emphasizes minimal a priori representational and computational assumptions, which explains why they tend to be so data-intensive. On the other hand, there is a lot of research into baking stronger relational inductive biases into deep learning architectures, e.g. with graph networks.2>In philosophy, inductive reasoning refers to generalization from specific observations to a conclusion.

      "The standard backpropagation algorithm (gradient descent) gets serious issues when the number of layers becomes large. The probability of local minima in the error function increases with every layer. Not only local minima in a mathematical sense cause problems, sometimes there are just flat regions in the error function (modifying one or more weights does not significantly change the error) where gradient descent does not work.On the other hand, networks with many layers can solve more difficult problems, as every layer of cells can also provide a layer of abstraction.Deep Learning addresses exactly this problem. The basic idea is to perform an unsupervised learning procedure on every single layer in addition to using gradient descent for the network as a whole. The goal of the unsupervised learning is to make each single layer extract characteristic features out of its input that can be used by subsequent layers.Although the term \"Deep Learning\" is currently being used much too widely, it is more than just a marketing hype.Edit: A few years ago, many people, including myself, believed that unsupervised pre-training was the main enabler of deep learning.

      "The idea I'm suggesting is originated in text-processing, NLP and information retrieval and very widely used in situations where you have sequences of characters/information like Genetic information. Because you have to preserve the sequence, we can use the concepts of n-grams. I'm using bi-grams in the following example, though you can generalize for higher order grams. N-grams help in preserving the sequential pattern in the data. Don't worry - we keep borrowing ideas from other fields of science - even edit distance and dynamic programming were not originally computer science concepts.There are many possible approaches to tackle this problem - each one unique, and there's no right one - atleast there's no sufficient research that proves which one is right. Here's my take on it. So the goal is to create a Bag-Of-Words like vector out of your data strings - and these vectors can be easily fed to any machine learning tool or library for clustering. A quick summary of steps:-Collect bigrams (and unigrams etc)Create a dictionary to get Bag Of Words (Code attached)Create functionality to get vector from a stringLet's get startedSo here These functions would convert the given string to a set of two characters (and single character if there's only one). You can modify them to capture 3-grams or even complete set of all possible uni-, bi- and tri-grams. Feel free to experiment.Now how to convert strings to vectors? We'll define a function that will convert string to vectors taking care of how many times a particular n-gram appears. This is called BAG OF WORDS. Here, these are BAGS OF SCREENS. Following two functions help you with that:Voila! We're done. Now feed your data vectors to any K-Means implementation of your choice. I used SKLearn. You should rather choose to read strings from a fileAnd then I finally see what my clusters look like using km.labels_ property of KMeans class.Here're your clusters. Look at the console (bottom) window - There are ten clusters.Now you can modify feature generation I wrote in the code and see how your modifications performs. Rather than just bigrams, extract all the possible unigrams, bigrams and trigrams and use them to create BOW. There will be significant difference. You can also use length of the string as a feature. You can also experiment with other algorithms including hierarchical clustering. Be sure to send me updated results after your modifications.Enjoy! \n",

Then why not ? Why not  etc.? Why not to include some reweighting based on unigrams when bigrams are not available?

It can be done using Unix command .Explanation: In an extreme case, if the training data contains first all negative examples followed by all positive examples, then it is quite probable that the model will learn to classify (almost) everything as positive.Another common reason that might result in low F1-measure (and almost all predictions positive) is imbalanced data (many positive examples, few negative examples). This was not the case of the dataset in Satarupa Guha's question, but I keep my original answer here:The obvious solution is to give a higher (than the default 1) importance weight to the negative examples. The optimal value of the importance weight can be found using a heldout set.The threshold for negative vs. positive prediction should be 0.Note that one of the great advantages of Vowpal Wabbit is that you do not need to convert feature names (words in your case) to integers. You can use the raw (tokenized) text, just make sure to escape pipe \"|\" and colon \":\" (and space and newline). Of course, if you already converted the words to integers, you can use it.\n",

      "I suggest to use the Linux \"date\" command to convert the date to the unix time stamps. Unix time stamp are the number of seconds elapsed since 1 January 1970. So basically a year is 60s*60m*24h*256d seconds. So, if the difference between the time stamps is more than this number then it is longer than a year.It will be something like this:So if you use perl, which is a pretty cool file handling language, you will parse your whole file in a few lines and use eval\"you date command\".\n",

      "I'm not sure your conjecture is true. Because of the nature of complete-linkage clustering, each time you agglomerate two clusters, you are doing so because the two elements that are farthest apart between those two clusters, are still mutually closer to each other than the farthest elements to any other cluster.What you're trying to prove is that However, after merging two clusters A and B due to complete-linkage clustering, there could still exist an element in cluster C that is nearer to an element in Cluster AB than any other element in cluster AB because complete-linkage is only concerned about maximal distances.2>3>The observations, A, B, C, D, and E are arranged in a straight line.Observation A is 1 unit away from observation BObservation B is 3 units away from observation CObservation C is 2.5 units away from observation DObservation D is 2 units away from observation ELet's perform hierarchical clustering:First A and B are merged because distance is 1:New picture:Cluster AB is 4 units away from observation C (because A is 4 units from C due to complete-linkage clustering), which is 2.5 units from D, which is 2 units from ENext, D and E are merged because distance is 2New pictureCluster AB is 4 units from observation C (as before), which is 4.5 units from Cluster DE because C is 4.5 units from E due to complete-linkage clustering.Next, C would need to be merged into AB because its distance is 4 whereas it's 4.5 to DE:Cluster ABC is 8.5 units from DE because A is 8.5 units from E.BUT, at this point we've disproven your conjecture. Element C is 3 units from B and 4 units from A (refer to original diagram). However, Element C is only 2.5 units from element D, which is inside another cluster.\n",

      "Are you sure you want cluster analysis?To find similar records you don't need cluster analysis. Simply find similar records with any distance measure such as Jaccard similarity or Hamming distance (both of which are for binary data). Or cosine distance, so that you can use e.g. Lucene to find similar records fast.To find common patterns, the use of frequent itemset mining may yield much more meaningful results, because these can work on a subset of attributes only. For example, in a supermarket, the columns Noodles, Tomato, Basil, Cheese may constitute a frequent pattern.Most clustering algorithms attempt to divide the data into k groups. While this at first appears a good idea (get k target groups) it rarely matches what real data contains. For example customers: why would every customer belong to exactly one audience? What if the audiences are e.g. car lovers, gun lovers, football lovers, soccer moms - are you sure you don't want to allow overlap of these groups?Furhermore, a problem with cluster analysis is that it's incredibly easy to use badly. It does not \"fail hard\" - you always get a result, and you might not realize that it's a bad result...\n",

      "For boosting task you need to pick best classifier on each iteration of algorithm. To do so you need to minimize average error of stump on dataset with respect to weights, so you must take into account weights of objects while counting error measure of a classifier. Thus penalty of classifier for incorrect labeling of object with big weight will be bigger than penalty for incorrect labeling of object with small weight.You can see my  of boosting on decision trees on R language, it works well, for decision stumps, just change depth of tree on line 132 to 1, and you can test accuracy with different number of classifiers changing parameter T.If you need deeper understanding: You can learn stumps in same way as tree of depth 1. To learn tree on weighted dataset you need to pick feature and value that separates dataset in best way to 2 parts by chosen feature according to weighted metrics, for example . You can just iterate with for loop over all available features, in nested loop sort picked feature and try all possible separations of dataset into two sets S, according to chosen feature and separator value, then calculate entropy over every set as it is written on wikipedia, but instead of calculating p(x) asyou need to sum all weights of objects with class x in set and divide this number by sum over all weights of objects in this set.where  - all weights of objects in set S, and  - all weights of objects in set S with class x.Then you can calculate information gain, but again, you need to use weighted proportion p(t) instead of variant in wikipedia (proportion of numbers).where  - set of weights of objects from initial (not divided by separator) set.and  - set of weights of objects from set t (you will get 2 set's t by separating S with some separator value)Pick feature and separator value which gives you biggest gain and that's all, you have just learned new stump classifier on weighted data and it is ready for work.I've made some pic to provide example of computation, here i picked only 1 separator, you need to check gain for every possible separator.\n",
